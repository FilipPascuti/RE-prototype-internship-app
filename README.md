## Running the server

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install pipenv

pipenv install
```

Or an easier method is to install the pipenv package and open the project with PyCharm and it will propt you with the dependencies instalation.


Type the command inside the Giobbo folder (which contains the manage.py file).

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Or

```bash
./manage.py runserver
```
